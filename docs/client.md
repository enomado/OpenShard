# The client

The shard has always been server-only: the client is ClassicUO, and
`crates/common/protocol` is the contract between them. This document is the plan
for a second client — ours — and it starts where every client starts, by
connecting and walking into the world.

The order below is not a wish list. Each milestone is the smallest thing that
can be run and disbelieved, and each one is a prerequisite of the next: nothing
renders before the bytes arrive, and nothing arrives before the protocol can be
read in the direction a client reads it.

## What is already here, and what is missing

The protocol crate is complete in *one direction*. The server decodes what a
client sends and encodes what a server sends, so every packet type implements
exactly the half the server needed:

- `ClientPacket::decode` exists; `ClientPacket::encode` does not.
- `ServerPacket::encode` exists; `ServerPacket::decode` does not.
- `client_packet_length` and `frame_client_packet` exist. There is no
  server-to-client length table at all — the server has never needed one,
  because it knows the length of what it writes.
- `huffman::compress` and `huffman::decompress` both exist, but `decompress`
  takes a whole buffer and expects it to end at a terminator. A client reads a
  socket, not a buffer.

The readers for the client's own data files — `map`, `statics`, `uop`,
`tiledata`, `terrain` — live in `crates/server/world`. A client crate may not
depend on them: `server/*` and `client/*` never depend on each other. They move
to `crates/common` before anything draws a tile.

None of this is a defect. It is what "sans-io, server-side" honestly produces,
and the missing halves are mostly mechanical. What matters is that they are
*missing*, and that they are the first milestone.

## M0 — the protocol, in the other direction

Nothing else can start. Four pieces:

1. **`server_packet_length` and `frame_server_packet`.** The mirror of the
   client table. The numbers are not re-derived from a reference: every
   server-to-client payload already declares `EncodePacket::LENGTH`, so the
   table reads those constants and holds no second copy to fall out of step —
   the same argument as `ServerPacket::id`.

   An id our server never sends is `None`, i.e. fatal for the connection. That
   is deliberate: guessing a length for a packet nobody here writes would put a
   made-up number in the one table whose whole purpose is to be right.

2. **The decode side of `ServerPacket`, and the encode side of `ClientPacket`.**
   Not all at once — the login set first (`0x82 0xA8 0x8C 0xA9 0x1B 0x55 0x11
   0x78 0x1A 0x20 0x22 0x21 0xBF`), the rest as a milestone needs them.

3. **Incremental Huffman.** A game connection compresses *every write
   independently, terminator and all* (see `Session::send_packet`), so a client
   needs a decoder that can say "this many input bytes produced this block, and
   the rest is the next one". That is a `decompress_prefix` returning the
   payload and the bytes consumed; `decompress` becomes the one-shot case of it.

   **A block is not a packet, and assuming it is passes every unit test.** The
   login server answers a `0x91` with the feature mask and the character list in
   one buffer, which is compressed as one 1,115-byte block carrying two packets.
   Decompression fills a byte stream and framing splits *that* — two layers,
   kept apart, the way ClassicUO does it. This cost nothing to fix and would
   have cost a day to find without the end-to-end test below, which is what
   found it.

4. **Round-trip tests.** Until now an encoder could only be checked against
   hand-written bytes or against itself. With both halves present, every packet
   gets `encode(decode(x)) == x` — which tests the server's encoders with a real
   inverse for the first time.

## M1 — `crates/client/net`: connect, and enter the world

The milestone the whole plan hangs on, and the one that can be finished and
believed on its own.

- A sans-io `Connection`, the mirror image of `gateway::Connection`:
  `receive(bytes)` in, `poll() -> Event` out, an outgoing queue, and no socket
  anywhere near it. Byte boundaries are what is hard here, and a real socket
  will not reproduce them on demand.
- The login state machine: seed → `0x80` → `0xA8` → `0xA0` → `0x8C` → **a second
  socket** → seed + `0x91` → `0xA9` → `0x5D` → `0x1B` / `0x55` → in the world.
  The auth key from the relay is the only thing linking the two sockets, and the
  version travels in the seed — both are findings the server already paid for,
  and the client has to honour the same two.
- A Tokio driver in its own file that decides nothing.
- `WorldView`: what the server has shown us — our own serial, position and
  direction, the mobiles and ground items we have been sent, light, season, map.
  It is the client's side of `World::seen`, and it is a record of what arrived,
  never a guess about what is there.
- Walking: `0x02` with its sequence and fastwalk key, `0x22` to confirm, `0x21`
  to roll back to what the server says. This is the first place the client must
  be *right* rather than merely plausible — a mishandled reject desynchronises
  the position and everything drawn after it.

Done when an integration test drives the real server through the whole
conversation with this crate, and when the binary walks a character around a
live `cargo run -p openshard-server`.

That test lives in **`crates/e2e`**, a group of its own beside `common`,
`server` and `client`. It needs both ends in one process, and putting it on
either side would make that side depend on the other — the rule those two live
by. So it sits outside both, ships no code of its own, and nothing depends on
it. It is also what turned `crates/server/server` into a library with a
four-line binary: a test that wants a shard should call one, not build one.

Only what cannot be tested on one side belongs there. Framing, the login machine
and the tick all have better tests of their own; what is left for `e2e` is that
two correct ends actually agree — which is exactly what caught the compression
mistake above, on the first run.

## M2 — `crates/common/uofiles`: the data files

The move first: `map`, `uop`, `tiledata`, and the format-reading half of
`terrain` leave `crates/server/world` for a crate both sides may depend on. The
world crate keeps the gameplay built on top of them.

Then the readers a renderer needs and a server never did: `hues`, `art` (land
and static), `gumpart`, `anim` with `animdata`, `unifont`, `cliloc`, `multi`,
`texmaps`, `light`, `radarcol`, `sound`, `verdata`. In that order the first
picture needs hues, land art, and the tiledata and map readers that already
exist.

No client files enter this repository, now or ever. Tests read
`OPENSHARD_CLIENT` and skip when it is unset.

## M3 — the first picture

Isometric 44×44 diamonds, ground only to begin with: no statics, no mobiles.
A flat green field in the right place proves the block loading, the coordinate
system and the hue table, and proves them separately from the sorting problem.

Then statics, then mobiles, then the labels — and with them UO's draw order,
which is the part of a UO renderer that is actually hard. The camera follows
`0x20`, and blocks load around the player.

## M4 — the gump layer

The journal and the speech line, the status bar, the paperdoll, containers, and
generic gumps: `0xB0` is already encoded by the server, so the client needs the
decoder and a layout parser for it.

## M5 — interaction

Single and double click (`0x09`, `0x06`), drag and drop (`0x07`, `0x08`),
targeting (`0x6C`, `0x6B`), speech (`0xAD`), war mode.

## Decisions to take before they are taken by accident

- **Crates.** `crates/client/net`, `crates/client/render`, `crates/client/app`,
  plus `crates/common/uofiles`. The direction rule stands: a client crate
  depends on `common`, never on `server`.
- **Which version we claim to be.** The client announces one in its seed, and
  every `Feature` gate on the server follows from it. 7.0.45.65 — what
  ClassicUO opens with — keeps us on the modern packet set instead of the legacy
  branches of every encoder.
- **A client that only speaks what our server happens to send is a mirror, not
  a UO client.** That is the right scope for M1–M3, and it is also how both
  ends quietly agree on the same mistake. Every packet this client learns should
  be checked against a real client's behaviour, not only against our own server.

## Backlog, found while building M0, M1 and M1a

Each is a seam the work made visible. None blocks the next milestone.

- **A walking client has no map, so `z` never changes under it.**
  `openshard_movement::intend` carries the height over unchanged — height is
  the terrain's answer and neither end of `intend` has terrain — so
  `client_net::walk::Walk` predicts a flat world. The server, which does read
  the map, lands the step wherever the ground is, and says nothing: `0x22`
  carries no position. A client walking up a hill therefore drifts in `z` until
  a `0x20` or a `0x21` corrects it. The fix is the map, which is M2; until then
  the drift is documented rather than papered over, because a guessed height
  would be indistinguishable from a real one.
- **`enter_world` drops everything between `0x1B` and `0x55`.** It builds the
  `WorldView` from the entry packet and then reads until the `0x55`, without
  applying anything that arrives in between — and that window is exactly where
  a shard sends the player's own `0x20`, the `0x78` for everyone already on
  screen, and the ground items. Harmless for a login test, wrong for a client
  that wants to draw the moment it is allowed to. The loop needs to `apply`
  what it reads, not skip it.
- **Nothing on the client models a status bar, and two packets are waiting for
  one.** `MobileStatus` (`0x11`) decodes and is deliberately not folded into
  `WorldView`; `WalkAck`'s notoriety reaches the caller through
  `walk::Moved::Stepped` and has nowhere to go either. Both are the same
  missing thing — health-bar colour and paperdoll numbers are not positions —
  and both should land wherever M4's status bar does.

- **The shard sends the feature mask and the character list as one write.**
  Correct, and worth naming: it means "one compressed block" and "one packet"
  are different things on this wire, and any future reader — a proxy, a packet
  logger, a second client — has to keep the two layers apart.
- ~~**`ServerPacket::decode` covers the login set only.**~~ Fixed: `0x20`,
  `0x11`, `0x77`, `0x78`, `0x1A` and `0x1D` all decode now. `WorldView` folds
  five of them in — a client's own body, every other mobile, every ground
  item, and what `0x1D` takes back off screen. `MobileStatus` (`0x11`) decodes
  too but stays out of `WorldView`: it is paperdoll data, not a position, and
  belongs with whatever eventually models the status bar. Its `max_weight` is
  honestly lossy below status type 5 — the wire never carries it that old, so
  decoding gets `0` back rather than a guess at a real value.
- **`CharacterList` decodes only the post-7.0.13.0 form.** The older start list
  carries no coordinates, so there is no honest `StartLocation` to build; the
  decoder says so rather than inventing zeros. If this engine ever wants to be
  a client to an *old* shard, that is where to start.
- ~~**The client-to-server encoders are still labelled "test fixtures only".**~~
  Fixed: `AccountLogin::encode`, `SelectShard::encode`, `GameServerLogin::encode`
  and `CharacterPlay::encode` now say what `crates/client/net`'s login state
  machine (`session.rs`) actually calls them for. Only `ClientVersionReport::encode`
  is genuinely still test-fixtures only, since the client does not announce its
  version yet.
- **`Login` fixes the seed value at `0x0A000001`.** It is never read — see
  `RawSeedValue` — but a client that will one day face a shard implementing
  login encryption will need it to be the value that keys the cipher.
- **The `0x82` refusal loses why.** `DenyReason::from_wire_code` returns one
  reason per wire code because the wire has five, and the server collapsed
  fifteen into them. Nothing to fix on this side; worth remembering before
  anyone builds a UI that explains a failed login.
