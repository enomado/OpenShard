# Shadow-raymarch boundary correctness: fixes, oracle, tooling

A living plan, in the shape the other plans here have: the decisions numbered
so one can be argued with alone, the steps, and a backlog of what was found on
the way and left undone.

Born from a thread inside [`lighting.md`](lighting.md), not from a survey: its
"Fixed: the shadow-raymarch anomaly" entry found the same class of bug twice —
once on the GPU side (`mesh_face.wgsl`'s `fract()`), once still open on the
CPU side (`light.rs`'s `walk_cells`/`sample`) — and left a second, unrelated
shape unexplained, with no instrument that could have told the two apart
without a screenshot. Split out because it is not one fix: it is the shape of
bug (a cell index re-derived from a float that can legitimately sit on the
cell's own boundary), the tooling that makes the next instance of it cheap to
find, and one still-open picture nobody has explained yet — enough sessions'
worth of work that it does not belong buried in `lighting.md`'s own "next
session" note.

Written against `crates/client/render/src/light.rs`, `mesh_face.rs`,
`mesh_face.wgsl`, `blit.wgsl`, `statics.rs`, `debug.rs`, `tests/lighting.rs`,
`examples/synthetic_stair.rs`, `examples/isolated_scene.rs`.

## Where the next session starts

Nothing done yet — this doc was just split out of `lighting.md`. Start at
step 1.

## Steps

- [x] **1. `blit.wgsl` — separate "blocked" from "empty" in `View::Shadow`.**
      `through == 0.0` (a ray this pixel *has*, fully stopped) and
      `KIND_NOTHING` (no ray at all, empty background) both paint pure black
      today. Cost this track a wrong diagnosis twice already — an "orphaned
      fragment" that was just a shadowed pixel next to background, and "one
      face instead of six" that was the same confusion at a different corner.
      One line: give blocked-but-on-mesh a distinct, dark, non-black colour
      (a dark red reads as "answer: none" without competing with `Lit`'s
      palette). Diagnostics only, zero risk, no test depends on the exact
      colour — do this one first, in isolation.
- [x] **2. `Spot` carries its own tile, `walk_cells` stops re-deriving it.**
      The CPU twin of the already-shipped `MeshFaceVertex::tile`
      (`mesh_face.rs`) fix. Add `tile: (i32, i32)` to `Spot`
      (`light.rs:1189`); `Spot::at`/`::flat`/`::face` take it from the
      caller, who already knows it — `statics.rs`'s `push_mesh` has `at.x`/
      `at.y` right where it builds a vertex today, `debug.rs:219` iterates
      whole tiles, every test fixture in `tests/lighting.rs`/`onsite.rs`/
      `frame.rs` and `artscan/examples/probe.rs` already names a `tile`
      variable it currently throws away by building a bare `Vec2`.
      `walk_cells`'s `first` (`light.rs:1681`, `from[0].floor() as i32`)
      reads `spot.tile` instead of flooring `from` — `from` has already been
      nudged by `stand_clear`, so flooring it back is exactly the hazard
      `lighting.md`'s `INSIDE` constant and the `mesh_face.wgsl` fix both
      exist to name: a coordinate that legitimately sits on a whole number
      floors to the wrong side. This is the actual fix — 1, 3, 4 and 5 exist
      to make it safe to ship and to keep it from recurring elsewhere, not to
      replace it. Public API change on `Spot`, one commit, then the full
      CPU/GPU parity suite (`lighting.md` decision 9) — `cargo test -p
      openshard-client-render`.

      **Done, and it grew by one line the plan above did not name.** Fixing
      only `first` left `boundary[axis]`'s seed (the per-axis loop just below
      it, `let ahead = ...from.floor() + 1.0 - from...`) still flooring the
      same nudged `from` to find the first grid-line crossing — consistent
      with the old, wrong `first` and inconsistent with the new, right one.
      A `from` sitting on its tile's exit edge would have `first` correctly
      say "you are in this tile" while `boundary[axis]` said "you are a
      whole tile short of its edge", handing the walk a tile of slack that
      was never there. Reads `[tile.0, tile.1][axis]` instead, the same
      fix in the same shape. All 15 call sites now name a tile explicitly;
      most already had one in scope (a test's own `tile`/`x, y` fixture
      variable, `debug.rs`'s tile iteration, `frame.rs`'s parity fixture's
      `(x, y)`). Three did not — `isolated_scene.rs`'s `run_profile` (an
      arbitrary point along a swept segment) and two interior-sweep helpers
      in `tests/lighting.rs` — and got `.floor()` explicitly, which is
      **not** a regression: the profiler exists to show what a naive
      derivation does at a boundary, and the sweeps are genuinely interior
      points with nothing more authoritative to carry. Full crate builds
      (`cargo check --workspace --all-targets`); `cargo test -p
      openshard-client-render` is step 2's own remaining item below.
- [x] **3. A boundary unit test, written against the fixed `Spot`.** New test
      in `tests/lighting.rs`: `light::sample` at a handful of points
      straddling an exact integer tile edge (mirroring the real tread's
      `world.x = 1498.0`), a flame on one side, asserting `through` is
      continuous across the boundary rather than flipping. Must be added
      *after* step 2 lands, against the tile-carrying `Spot` — written
      against today's `Spot` it would just re-encode the bug it is meant to
      catch.

      **Done as `a_point_on_its_own_tiles_far_edge_reads_that_tile_not_the_next_one`**,
      reusing `light::tests::a_treads_top_is_not_shadowed_by_its_own_riser`'s
      own fixture (a climbable three-tread `Prism`) rather than a new one,
      read at the tallest tread's own far `y` edge instead of its middle.
      **Verified it actually catches the regression, not just its own
      geometry**: temporarily reverted both `first = tile` and the
      `boundary[axis]` edge fix back to `.floor()` and reran — `through`
      dropped from `1.000` at the tile's middle to `0.513` exactly on its far
      edge, confirming the earlier, weaker draft (light east of an edge the
      ray only ever moves *away* from) had picked a geometry the bug does
      not reach at all: the wrong `first` only matters when the ray's own
      path actually re-crosses back into the tile it started on, which is
      why the working version sweeps the tile's `y` edge under the same
      east-facing light the proven fixture already uses, rather than
      chasing a new light position by hand.
- [ ] **4. A brute-force CPU oracle, independent of both DDA
      implementations.** A deliberately dumb ray sampler — fixed small steps
      along the ray, an occlusion lookup at each, no cell bookkeeping, no
      `floor()`/`fract()` reconstruction of any kind — compared per-pixel
      against `synthetic_stair`'s `View::Shadow` over a grid of light
      positions and angles. Shares no arithmetic with `walk_cells` or
      `mesh_face.wgsl`/`blit.wgsl`'s `walk()`, so it cannot inherit their bug
      the way a second DDA rewrite could. Where 3 catches *this* boundary, 4
      is the net for the next one, wherever it turns up.
- [ ] **5. Diagnose the second, still-unexplained shape.** The white line
      over empty background in `View::Shadow`, confirmed present and
      unchanged by the `mesh_face.wgsl` fix — see `lighting.md`'s "Fixed: the
      shadow-raymarch anomaly" entry, "The second shape..." — cause unknown.
      Start only after 1 and 2 land — 1 removes the blocked/background
      ambiguity that made it hard to even look at, 2 removes one
      already-known confound (the tile-boundary bug) from the list of
      suspects. Bisect with `OPENSHARD_SCENE_PROFILE_FACE` the way the
      tread's outer edge was bisected in `lighting.md`'s own entry.

## Backlog

Findings go here as they turn up, same convention as `lighting.md`'s own
backlog: what the finding is, why it is worth touching, `file:line` where
there is one.

- **A true fixed-point world coordinate (tile + N bits of sub-tile
  resolution, one integer type, no `f32`) would remove this whole class of
  bug at the source instead of working around it.** Raised while doing step
  2: `Spot.tile` plus an `f32` fraction is already a *hybrid* of this — it
  mirrors `mesh_face.wgsl`/`blit.wgsl`'s own `(tile, sub)` pair — and once
  the tile is carried and never re-derived, the fraction sitting on an exact
  boundary is harmless: nothing branches on it for cell selection anymore.
  So a full fixed-point rewrite buys **nothing more for this specific bug
  class** than step 2 already closes. What it would buy is broader: no float
  epsilon anywhere a world position is stored or compared, which is a
  question about `geometry::Vec2`, the camera, movement and the protocol —
  not about lighting, and not scoped to one crate. Left here rather than
  turned into a step: worth a decision of its own, on its own track, if it
  is ever picked up — not a rider on this one.

## Handoff log

One entry per session, newest first. What changed, what was learned, what the
next session should read before touching anything. Append, do not rewrite —
a wrong turn kept and marked wrong is worth more than a tidied history.
