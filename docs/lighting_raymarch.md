# Shadow-raymarch boundary correctness: fixes, oracle, tooling

A living plan, in the shape the other plans here have: the decisions numbered
so one can be argued with alone, the steps, and a backlog of what was found on
the way and left undone.

Born from a thread inside [`lighting.md`](lighting.md), not from a survey: its
"Fixed: the shadow-raymarch anomaly" entry found the same class of bug twice —
once on the GPU side (`mesh_face.wgsl`'s `fract()`), once still open on the
CPU side (`light.rs`'s `walk_cells`/`sample`) — and left a second, unrelated
shape unexplained, with no instrument that could have told the two apart
without a screenshot. Split out because it is not one fix: it is the shape of
bug (a cell index re-derived from a float that can legitimately sit on the
cell's own boundary), the tooling that makes the next instance of it cheap to
find, and one still-open picture nobody has explained yet — enough sessions'
worth of work that it does not belong buried in `lighting.md`'s own "next
session" note.

Written against `crates/client/render/src/light.rs`, `mesh_face.rs`,
`mesh_face.wgsl`, `blit.wgsl`, `statics.rs`, `debug.rs`, `tests/lighting.rs`,
`examples/synthetic_stair.rs`, `examples/isolated_scene.rs`.

## Where the next session starts

Nothing done yet — this doc was just split out of `lighting.md`. Start at
step 1.

## Steps

- [ ] **1. `blit.wgsl` — separate "blocked" from "empty" in `View::Shadow`.**
      `through == 0.0` (a ray this pixel *has*, fully stopped) and
      `KIND_NOTHING` (no ray at all, empty background) both paint pure black
      today. Cost this track a wrong diagnosis twice already — an "orphaned
      fragment" that was just a shadowed pixel next to background, and "one
      face instead of six" that was the same confusion at a different corner.
      One line: give blocked-but-on-mesh a distinct, dark, non-black colour
      (a dark red reads as "answer: none" without competing with `Lit`'s
      palette). Diagnostics only, zero risk, no test depends on the exact
      colour — do this one first, in isolation.
- [ ] **2. `Spot` carries its own tile, `walk_cells` stops re-deriving it.**
      The CPU twin of the already-shipped `MeshFaceVertex::tile`
      (`mesh_face.rs`) fix. Add `tile: (i32, i32)` to `Spot`
      (`light.rs:1189`); `Spot::at`/`::flat`/`::face` take it from the
      caller, who already knows it — `statics.rs`'s `push_mesh` has `at.x`/
      `at.y` right where it builds a vertex today, `debug.rs:219` iterates
      whole tiles, every test fixture in `tests/lighting.rs`/`onsite.rs`/
      `frame.rs` and `artscan/examples/probe.rs` already names a `tile`
      variable it currently throws away by building a bare `Vec2`.
      `walk_cells`'s `first` (`light.rs:1681`, `from[0].floor() as i32`)
      reads `spot.tile` instead of flooring `from` — `from` has already been
      nudged by `stand_clear`, so flooring it back is exactly the hazard
      `lighting.md`'s `INSIDE` constant and the `mesh_face.wgsl` fix both
      exist to name: a coordinate that legitimately sits on a whole number
      floors to the wrong side. This is the actual fix — 1, 3, 4 and 5 exist
      to make it safe to ship and to keep it from recurring elsewhere, not to
      replace it. Public API change on `Spot`, one commit, then the full
      CPU/GPU parity suite (`lighting.md` decision 9) — `cargo test -p
      openshard-client-render`.
- [ ] **3. A boundary unit test, written against the fixed `Spot`.** New test
      in `tests/lighting.rs`: `light::sample` at a handful of points
      straddling an exact integer tile edge (mirroring the real tread's
      `world.x = 1498.0`), a flame on one side, asserting `through` is
      continuous across the boundary rather than flipping. Must be added
      *after* step 2 lands, against the tile-carrying `Spot` — written
      against today's `Spot` it would just re-encode the bug it is meant to
      catch.
- [ ] **4. A brute-force CPU oracle, independent of both DDA
      implementations.** A deliberately dumb ray sampler — fixed small steps
      along the ray, an occlusion lookup at each, no cell bookkeeping, no
      `floor()`/`fract()` reconstruction of any kind — compared per-pixel
      against `synthetic_stair`'s `View::Shadow` over a grid of light
      positions and angles. Shares no arithmetic with `walk_cells` or
      `mesh_face.wgsl`/`blit.wgsl`'s `walk()`, so it cannot inherit their bug
      the way a second DDA rewrite could. Where 3 catches *this* boundary, 4
      is the net for the next one, wherever it turns up.
- [ ] **5. Diagnose the second, still-unexplained shape.** The white line
      over empty background in `View::Shadow`, confirmed present and
      unchanged by the `mesh_face.wgsl` fix — see `lighting.md`'s "Fixed: the
      shadow-raymarch anomaly" entry, "The second shape..." — cause unknown.
      Start only after 1 and 2 land — 1 removes the blocked/background
      ambiguity that made it hard to even look at, 2 removes one
      already-known confound (the tile-boundary bug) from the list of
      suspects. Bisect with `OPENSHARD_SCENE_PROFILE_FACE` the way the
      tread's outer edge was bisected in `lighting.md`'s own entry.

## Backlog

Nothing yet — findings go here as they turn up, same convention as
`lighting.md`'s own backlog: what the finding is, why it is worth touching,
`file:line` where there is one.

## Handoff log

One entry per session, newest first. What changed, what was learned, what the
next session should read before touching anything. Append, do not rewrite —
a wrong turn kept and marked wrong is worth more than a tidied history.
