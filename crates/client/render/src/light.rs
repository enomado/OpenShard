//! Firelight: the pools of warm light a torch, a brazier or a campfire lays on
//! the ground around it.
//!
//! # In the world's own units, not the screen's
//!
//! A light is a tile, a height and a reach in tiles; a fragment is lit according
//! to the tile *its own picture* came from, which the world passes wrote into
//! [`crate::place`]. The screen never enters it. It cannot: the screen folds
//! height into `y`, so a brazier in a cellar lands a few pixels from a lantern
//! on the street above, and a wall's picture stands 44 pixels above the tile it
//! occludes from — which puts the lit face of a wall inside its own shadow the
//! moment shadows exist at all. `docs/lighting.md` is the argument at length.
//!
//! # Why it is a pass over the finished image and not a term in three shaders
//!
//! Everything here ends up as a handful of point lights in the *drawn image's*
//! own pixels, applied once by [`crate::blit`] on the way to the surface. The
//! alternative — a light term in `ground.wgsl`, `statics.wgsl` and the mobile
//! pass — is three copies of one formula, three uniform blocks to keep in step,
//! and a frame where a body walking past a fire is lit by a slightly different
//! curve than the flagstone it is standing on. There is nothing a per-object
//! pass would buy: UO's art is flat pictures with no normals, so "lit" means
//! exactly *brighter near the flame*, and where a pixel is on the screen is the
//! whole of what that needs.
//!
//! # What a light is, and what says so
//!
//! [`TileFlags::LIGHT_SOURCE`] — the client's own answer. A graphic burns
//! because `tiledata.mul` says it burns, not because this file holds a list of
//! torch graphics, which would be a list somebody has to maintain against every
//! art patch and would silently miss a shard's custom brazier.
//!
//! What the flag does *not* carry is how big the pool is or what colour it
//! burns: the client reads those from `light.mul`, keyed by a light id this
//! workspace's `uofiles` does not parse yet. Until it does, [`flame`] picks a
//! shape from the graphic — one warm default, and a wider, brighter one for a
//! campfire. That is a deliberate stand-in and it is the one thing here that is
//! invention rather than port; see `docs/client.md`.
//!
//! # The flicker is on the CPU
//!
//! Two sine terms of incommensurable frequency, per light, sampled once per
//! frame and folded into the intensity that reaches the GPU. On the CPU because
//! a flame's brightness is one number for the whole pool — the shader would
//! recompute it identically for every pixel it touches — and because this crate
//! is not allowed to read a clock, so the time arrives as an argument and there
//! is exactly one place it is used.
